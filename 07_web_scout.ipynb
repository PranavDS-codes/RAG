    "            - Synthesize a **dense, information-rich paragraph** that directly answers the User Query based *only* on the Scraped Content.\n",
    "            - Remove conversational fluff (\"The article states...\", \"It is important to note...\").\n",
    "            - Focus on factual density: include dates, numbers, names, and specific technical details.\n",
    "            - This text will be embedded; ensure it is semantically complete and self-contained.\n",
    "\n",
    "            2. **GRAPH TRIPLES (The Knowledge Graph)**:\n",
    "            - Extract 5-15 semantic triples: `{\"head\": \"Subject\", \"relation\": \"Predicate\", \"tail\": \"Object\"}`.\n",
    "            - **Entity Rules (Head/Tail)**: Use precise Proper Nouns or technical concepts. Keep them atomic (e.g., \"Elon Musk\" instead of \"The CEO of Tesla Elon Musk\").\n",
    "            - **Relation Rules**: Use active, directed verbs (e.g., \"founded\", \"acquired\", \"located_in\", \"author_of\"). Avoid generic relations like \"is\" or \"has\" if a more specific one exists.\n",
    "            - **Canonicalization**: Resolve pronouns and aliases to their full names (e.g., replace \"he\" with the person's name).\n",
    "\n",
    "            3. **METADATA**:\n",
    "            - `confidence_score`: 0.0 (Irrelevant/Garbage) to 1.0 (Perfect, Factual Match).\n",
    "            - `category`: Classify the content into one specific domain tag (e.g., \"Market Data\", \"Technical Documentation\", \"Biography\", \"News\").\n",
